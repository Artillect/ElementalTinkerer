Elementium Ore is found around
the world. It can be spotted 
around sea level, never too 
deep though, when found, 
it's generally in a big cluster. 
But most of the elementium ore 
blocks are trapped with 
guardians, which will inflict 
a Mining Fatigue effect to try 
to prevent the natural order 
from being shattered. When 
mined, Elementium Ore drops an 
Elementium Gem.
